Knowledge we can use from Beeper Shob for the boilerplate:

1. obfuscation

2. websocket

3. grunt livereload


Specific knowledge - I don't know if it's relevant to the boilerplate, but it maybe worth to make some blog/wiki + real world example how we implemented it with EJBs.

1. wsdl2java

2. kerberos authentication

3. Mapping of objects from xsds

4. State machine


Knowledge I know exists on other teams and probably should be made into boilerplates:

1. Courelius

2. Ruby platform - Yossi

3. Titan platform - Roi
